This application allows you to understand, calculate, and simulate your career readiness in AI-driven labor markets.\n\n### Learning Goals\n-   Understand the key insights contained in the uploaded document and supporting data.\n-   Decompose the AI-Readiness Score into its systematic opportunity ($H^R$), idiosyncratic readiness ($V^R$), and synergy components.\n-   Evaluate the potential impact of various learning pathways on individual skill development and career readiness.\n-   Analyze different career paths based on market demand and personal capabilities through \"what-if\" scenarios.\n\nFormulae, explanations, tables, etc. can be added here to provide more details about the lab and the underlying concepts.\"\"\"\

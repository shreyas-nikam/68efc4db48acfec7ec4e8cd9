# AI-Readiness Score (AI-R) Codelab: A Guide to Navigating AI-Enabled Careers

This codelab will guide you through the QuLab application, designed to help you understand and quantify your preparedness for AI-enabled careers. In an era where Artificial Intelligence is rapidly transforming industries, understanding your AI-Readiness is crucial for making informed career decisions. This application provides a framework to assess your capabilities and evaluate market opportunities, enabling you to navigate career transitions effectively.

This application will help you understand:

*   The AI-Readiness Score (AI-R) framework.
*   The key components that contribute to your AI-Readiness: Idiosyncratic Readiness ($V^R$), Systematic Opportunity ($H^R$), and Synergy.
*   How different learning pathways can impact your skill development and career readiness.
*   How to analyze various career paths based on market demand and personal capabilities.

## Exploring the AI-Readiness Score Calculator

Duration: 00:10

The AI-Readiness Score Calculator is the core of the QuLab application. It allows you to input your individual capabilities and explore different career options to determine your AI-Readiness Score. This score is a parametric model that quantifies your preparedness for AI-enabled careers, considering both your individual strengths and the opportunities available in the market.

## Understanding the AI-Readiness Score Components

Duration: 00:15

The AI-Readiness Score is composed of three main components:

*   **Idiosyncratic Readiness ($V^R$)**: This represents your individual capabilities, including AI fluency, domain expertise, and adaptive capacity.
*   **Systematic Opportunity ($H^R$)**: This reflects the market opportunities available for AI-related roles, considering factors like job growth, wage premium, and entry accessibility.
*   **Synergy**: This component captures the alignment between your individual readiness and the market opportunity, amplifying the AI-Readiness Score when there's a strong match.

Let's delve into each component in more detail using the application.

## Inputting Your Idiosyncratic Readiness ($V^R$) Factors

Duration: 00:20

1.  Navigate to the "AI-Readiness Score Calculator" page using the `Navigation` selectbox in the sidebar.
2.  Locate the "Idiosyncratic Readiness ($V^R$) Inputs" section. Here, you'll find several sub-components to evaluate your individual capabilities.
3.  **AI-Fluency Sub-Components**: Use the sliders to assess your proficiency in areas like prompting AI models, using AI tools, understanding AI concepts, and interpreting AI-generated data. Consider your experience and knowledge in each area to provide accurate ratings.
4.  **Domain-Expertise Sub-Components**: Evaluate your educational background, years of experience, portfolio, recognition, and credentials. Select your education level from the dropdown and use the sliders to rate your portfolio, recognition, and credentials.
5.  **Adaptive-Capacity Sub-Components**: Assess your cognitive flexibility, social-emotional intelligence, and strategic career management skills. Use the sliders to rate yourself in each of these areas.

## Evaluating Systematic Opportunity ($H^R$)

Duration: 00:15

1.  In the "AI-Readiness Score Calculator" page, find the "Systematic Opportunity ($H^R$) Inputs" section.
2.  Select a "Target Occupation" from the dropdown. This will populate the application with market data relevant to that specific role.
3.  Note the "Market Multiplier Parameters". The $\lambda$ (lambda) and $\gamma$ (gamma) values influence the growth and regional multipliers, respectively. You can adjust these sliders to explore how different market conditions impact your AI-Readiness Score.

<aside class="negative">
    The Systematic Opportunity ($H^R$) is highly dependent on the chosen occupation. Experiment with different roles to see how the market demand affects your overall AI-Readiness.
</aside>

## Understanding Synergy and Skills Matching

Duration: 00:20

1.  Locate the "Synergy Inputs" section on the "AI-Readiness Score Calculator" page.
2.  This section focuses on how well your skills match the requirements of your chosen occupation.

<aside class="positive">
 The Synergy component highlights the importance of aligning your skills with the demands of the market.
</aside>

## Analyzing the AI-Readiness Score Results and Visualizations

Duration: 00:15

1.  After inputting all the required information, the application calculates and displays your AI-Readiness Score and its components in the "AI-Readiness Score Calculation" section.
2.  Review the metrics for Idiosyncratic Readiness ($V^R$), Systematic Opportunity ($H^R$), and Synergy to understand your strengths and areas for improvement.
3.  Examine the visualizations provided, such as the pie chart for $V^R$ components and the bar chart for $H_{base}$ components, to gain deeper insights into the factors influencing your score.

## Simulating Learning Pathways to Enhance Your AI-Readiness

Duration: 00:20

1.  Navigate to the "Pathway Simulation" page using the `Navigation` selectbox.
2.  Select a "Learning Pathway" from the dropdown. Each pathway is designed to enhance specific skills, such as AI fluency, domain expertise, or adaptive capacity.
3.  Adjust the "Pathway Completion Score" and "Pathway Mastery Score" sliders to reflect your expected level of engagement and understanding.
4.  Click the "Simulate Pathway Impact" button to see how the selected pathway can potentially improve your AI-Fluency, Domain-Expertise, and Adaptive-Capacity.
5.  Analyze the "Simulation Results" to understand the potential impact of the learning pathway on your $V^R$ components.

<aside class="positive">
 The Pathway Simulation allows you to strategically plan your learning journey to maximize your AI-Readiness.

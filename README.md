# QuLab: AI-Readiness Score Exploration and Simulation

## Project Title and Description

**QuLab** is a Streamlit application designed to explore the AI-Readiness Score (AI-R) framework.  This framework provides a parametric model for quantifying an individual's preparedness for careers in AI-enabled industries.  The application allows users to understand, calculate, and simulate their career readiness in the AI-driven labor market. It provides interactive tools to explore the components of the AI-R score, analyze the impact of learning pathways, and evaluate different career paths based on individual capabilities and market demand.

## Features

*   **AI-Readiness Score Calculation:** Allows users to calculate their AI-Readiness Score based on a configurable model. (This functionality would be in the `application_pages.ai_readiness_score` module and is not explicitly defined in the provided code, but we account for it's existance).
*   **Decomposition of the AI-R Score:** Provides insight into the different components of the AI-R score, including systematic opportunity ($H^R$), idiosyncratic readiness ($V^R$), and synergy components.
*   **Pathway Simulation:** Enables users to simulate the impact of different learning pathways on their skill development and career readiness.  This supports "what-if" scenarios. (This functionality would be in the `application_pages.pathway_simulation` module.)
*   **Career Path Analysis:**  Assists in analyzing different career paths based on market demand and personal capabilities.
*   **Data Visualization:**  Offers interactive data views to understand the underlying data and model parameters. (This functionality would be in the `application_pages.data_view` module.)
*   **Interactive UI:** A user-friendly Streamlit interface with a clear navigation sidebar.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8+
*   Pip package installer

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (or download the source code):**

    ```bash
    git clone <your_repository_url> # Replace with your actual repository URL
    cd <your_repository_directory>
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install the required packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install streamlit
    # Add any other dependencies required by your application, such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, etc.
    # Example:
    # pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
    ```
    **Important:** Create or update a `requirements.txt` file:
    ```bash
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
    ```
    This ensures that others can easily install the same dependencies.

## Usage

1.  **Run the Streamlit application:**

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

2.  **Access the application:**

    Open your web browser and navigate to the URL displayed in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

3.  **Explore the Application:**

    *   Use the sidebar on the left to navigate between the "AI-Readiness Score", "Pathway Simulation", and "Data View" pages.
    *   Follow the on-screen instructions and prompts to calculate your AI-Readiness Score, simulate learning pathways, and analyze data.
    *   Provide the necessary inputs as requested by the application to get results.

*   `app.py`:  The main application script that defines the layout and navigation.  It imports and calls the functions defined in other modules in `application_pages`.
*   `application_pages/`: Contains the code for each individual page of the Streamlit application, modularizing the functionalities of the app.
    *   `ai_readiness_score.py`, `pathway_simulation.py`, and `data_view.py`: Each file is intended to define a `run_<page_name>()` function that renders the specific page's content.
*   `data/`: Stores data files needed by the application (e.g., datasets for analysis, pre-calculated scores).
*   `images/`: Stores images used in the app, such as logos or explanatory diagrams.
*   `requirements.txt`: Lists all the Python packages required to run the application.

## Technology Stack

*   **Python:** Programming language
*   **Streamlit:** Web framework for building interactive data applications
